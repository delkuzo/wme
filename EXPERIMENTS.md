# EXPERIMENTS (Experiments & Playground)

## Purpose
- Rapid prototyping of new interfaces
- Testing ideas without affecting the main system

## How to create
- For each experiment — a separate HTML file in the `experiments/` folder
- The file name should reflect the essence of the experiment (e.g., `user-table-experiment.html`)
- At the top of the file — a brief description of the experiment's goal
- For experiments with external libraries, use `gravity-ui-playground.html`

## How to structure
- Use components from the design system if possible
- New elements — follow the STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Don't be afraid to try unconventional solutions

## How to test
- Open the file in your browser
- Check functionality and appearance
- Write conclusions in comments or a separate section in the file

## How to transfer successful solutions
- If the experiment is successful — move the component/idea to the main design system
- Update documentation and checklists
